# Python tools for PlantUML

These are some tools that I have made for use in the weekly Python programming
handins, I am doing 2016-2018 at Lillebaelt Academy.

*These tools are a work in progress and updated on a regular basis.*

 * **dbdia2sql**: Convert database diagrams written in PlantUML into the
   SQL command to create the tables.
 * **py2uml**: Generate a PlantUML classes from Python source code.
